      <p style="font-size:20px;">Hello, my name is Isak Vestman and I am
        currently studying abroad in Lynnwood, Seattle. <br>
        Why I am in Seattle and in an different country is because I wanted to
        study abroad for year, as why I picked Seattle out of all towns I could
        study in was because, it reminds me of home. What I am studying is Web
        Development and Cloud Management, as it would help me broad out my
        horizons to get a job in the future. </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">As much as I love being in Lynnwood, my
        original hometown is in Ume√•, Sweden, there I lived my simple life
        together with my mom and both of my sisters through my entire life. Its
        more of a outskirt of the town in a calmer neighborhood, as it wasn't in
        the big city as Seattle is, so it's something new and challenging to
        deal with. Yet, it is really fun!</p>

        class="floatleft" height="8%" width="8%">
      <p style="font-size:20px;">Making videos and gaming are my big interests!
        I went to a highschool that was media production based called "NTI
        Gymnasiet" (Nordens Tekniker Institut) years ago and since then,
        I have a dream to work with videos, like a camera man or an editor, or
        anything related to Media Production. Which is why I am also studying
        Web Developer, with how close it is with Media Production. Being able to
        work with that would fulfill my dream, but getting there is an hussle.
        With several years of experience, I haven't gotten a job there yet.
        Hopefully this will change!</p>
      <p style="font-size:20px;">When you have the two interests combined, you can get
        pretty creative! If you don't know, I have an YouTube Channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pikamaxi" target="_blank">pikamaxi</a>! This
        channel contains both serious video work to goofy jokes within the
        gaming community! If you are into Super Smash Bros, Splatoon or Pokemon,
        be sure to follow me and let me entertain you!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Let me finish my homepage
        off by showing you one of my latest video work!</p>
