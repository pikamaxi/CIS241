      <h2 style="text-align:center;">Videos</h2>
      <p style="text-align:center;">As I have stated before in my homepage, I
        love videos! not as in watching them, but as in creating them. I have
        studied and have experience with film making in general, from a simple
        idea, story boarding, recording, editing to its final product. I have
        tons of videos created on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pikamaxi"

          target="_blank">YouTube Page</a> that I have created as early as 2006.
        Most of my videos there is about Machinimas (Videos using Games as a
        Source, like Super Smash Bros, Halo or Source FilmMaker) as I can easy
        create a full fledged story or just create something that is enjoyable
        for the moment for everyone to watch.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">The Editing phase is my favorite part of the
        film production, as you can see first hand of how the movie will turn
        out to be. The Recording phase is also really fun, especially when you
        are working with a scene and see the actors do the thing. With all the
        technical stuff that comes with it as well, like setting up the
        lightning, audio that needs to be recorded</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;">Have 3 videos that I have picked out: One I
        am proud off, one that's pure editing and one that's more technical in
        Machinima approach<br>

      <p>Games is my second passion, both playing them and creating them. When I
        was 5 years old, me and my sister got a Nintendo 64 as a Christmas gift
        from our mom with the game "Super Mario 64" and since the day we got to
        play it, I was in love with games. It is really hard to pin out my
        favorite game as my absolute favorite, but I can pick 5 games that I
        really love in no particular order.<br>
        The games I love is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</li>
        <li>Splatoon Series</li>
        <li>Xenoblade Chronicles</li>
        <li>Pokemon Series</li>
        <li>Super Mario Galaxy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Super Smash Bros is an game series that I have loved since it was
        released on the 64 back in the day. It is also the game that I am
        playing competitive in, as I go to tournaments and play against really
        skilled people. Fun Fact, back in my town, I am the second Super Smash
        Bros Ultimate player on our Power Ranking list (PR for short) as between
        June to September, 2019. Here is the <a href="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/73323869_2658201634201446_1346871378606817280_o.jpg?_nc_cat=107&amp;_nc_ohc=DnEvwYxYqpwAQk2qRHw_zdrWM1Rne6OtIvA06DgU0DyMooIZFHqjuqKkg&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sea1-1.xx&amp;oh=9c1663bc3b3795fd09914222193b115c&amp;oe=5E71C02C"

        class="floatleftgame">
      <p style="text-align:right;">Coding is something that has gotten my
        interests for the last decade, thanks to gaming. Just like why I love
        making videos, being able to see the progress by yourself when you do
        something is something I will always love, and coding is no exceptions.</p>
      <p style="text-align:right;">My true introduction with coding were by
        hacking Super Smash Bros Brawl in the early 2010s. I self-learned how to
        make custom attacks, custom animations, models, and textures for the
        game and it was an experience. With this, I also learned more advanced
        hacking, such as "Hex Hacking", "Assemble Hacking" and "PowerPC" hacking
        for the same game but not as big as the precious one.</p>
      <p style="text-align:right;"> This led me to create really advance hacks
        for the game, such as creating completely new characters, or a character
        that can change itself to another character with Wii's limited memory.<br>
        I were also in a group that helped the progress to customize the game
        further by, example, figuring out how the "PAT0" file to work and how to
        make our own That was years ago tho, since currently I haven't hacked
        the game as much as before. I go sometimes back to that game to create
        machinimas (why I started hacking in the first place) but I don't create
        huge hacking stuff there anymore. </p>
      <p style="text-align:right;"> But my interests for coding still exists. I
        am doing a Game on my own with help by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rpg-maker/"

          target="_blank">RPG Maker</a> Engine whenever I am not doing video
        work. <br>
        With this program, I can create RPG Games. For the last 3 years, I have
        been toddling and tinking with a game of mine that has tons of customize
        coding and animations. <br>
        More about this another time, but have a Picture of the game as a small
        preview! <br>

      <h2 id="my_baking" style="text-align:Center;">Baking</h2>
      <img src="../images/panna-cotta.jpg" alt="A good looking panna-cotta that is new made and creamy"

        class="floatright">
      <p>I have a huge Sweet-tooth, so me loving sweets and baking is not a big
        surprise. <br>
        This isn't as huge as the other 3 as I mentioned earlier, but being able
        to be creative is something I really love.</p>
      <p>I don't really have much money or time to actually bake, nor the tools
        to do so. But when I am available to, I gladly pick up the whisker and
        start whisking away.<br>
        One of my favorite desserts are Panna-cottas, when the cream has been
        whiskered perfectly with either berries or chocolate sauce to complement
        the good vanilla taste. Making them from scratch are really fun in my
        opinion, as it requires precision and knowledge about the cream. Mud
        cakes (a messy chocolate cake) and Fondant (A gooey chocolate muffin)
        and really fun too, and extremely tasty~</p>
      <p>While it is more about "food", but I also love making "Crepes". the
        process of making them reminds me of baking and I love having sweets on
        them, such as berries, chocolate or ice cream. Still trying to create
        the perfect crepe receipt whenever I eat crepes!</p>
