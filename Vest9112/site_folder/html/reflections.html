      <p>This is about what I thought about the CIS241 class. I really enjoyed
        what I was taught and I really enjoyed the time I spent.</p>
        <p>While coding HTML is relative close to the coding I have done in the
        past, I still learned new stuff and stuff I didn't expect, as well as I
        learned the HTML history.</p>
        <p>Something that I went "WOW" over was how alone the HTML coding is
        compared to other codes. What I mean is that the HTML code updates once
        when you visit a site, but doesn't keep itself updated until you reload
        it or visit another site on the website. Plugins and the newer HTML5
        helps keeping the connection so it can update all the time, but this
        information never really hit me in the head.</p>
      <p>With this learned HTML programming skill, I shall be a better coder and
        reach into new territory, such as learning Java Script and implement it
        on websites. Hopefully I can score at being a web designer in the
        future!</p>
